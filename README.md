# FCFS CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project simulates the **First Come First Serve (FCFS)** CPU scheduling algorithm.  
Each task has an **arrival time** and a **burst time**, and the program calculates:

- **Completion Time**: when the task finishes execution  
- **Turnaround Time**: total time spent in the system  
- **Waiting Time**: time spent waiting before execution  

The program prints a table with all the tasks’ information and calculates **average turnaround** and **average waiting times**.
